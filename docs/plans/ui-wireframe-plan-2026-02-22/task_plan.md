# Task Plan: UI wireframe research + framework selection plan
<!-- 
  WHAT: This is your roadmap for the entire task. Think of it as your "working memory on disk."
  WHY: After 50+ tool calls, your original goals can get forgotten. This file keeps them fresh.
  WHEN: Create this FIRST, before starting any work. Update after each phase completes.
-->

## Goal
<!-- 
  WHAT: One clear sentence describing what you're trying to achieve.
  WHY: This is your north star. Re-reading this keeps you focused on the end state.
  EXAMPLE: "Create a Python CLI todo app with add, list, and delete functionality."
-->
Produce a documented UI plan and shortlist of Next.js-compatible UI frameworks that fit a neo-brutalist, low-distraction wireframe approach, with sources and a clear recommendation path.

## Current Phase
<!-- 
  WHAT: Which phase you're currently working on (e.g., "Phase 1", "Phase 3").
  WHY: Quick reference for where you are in the task. Update this as you progress.
-->
Phase 5

## Phases
<!-- 
  WHAT: Break your task into 3-7 logical phases. Each phase should be completable.
  WHY: Breaking work into phases prevents overwhelm and makes progress visible.
  WHEN: Update status after completing each phase: pending → in_progress → complete
-->

### Phase 1: Requirements & Discovery
<!-- 
  WHAT: Understand what needs to be done and gather initial information.
  WHY: Starting without understanding leads to wasted effort. This phase prevents that.
-->
- [x] Confirm UI goals, style constraints, and scope boundaries
- [x] Identify candidate UI frameworks and official sources
- [x] Document findings in findings.md
- **Status:** complete
<!-- 
  STATUS VALUES:
  - pending: Not started yet
  - in_progress: Currently working on this
  - complete: Finished this phase
-->

### Phase 2: Planning & Structure
<!-- 
  WHAT: Decide how you'll approach the problem and what structure you'll use.
  WHY: Good planning prevents rework. Document decisions so you remember why you chose them.
-->
- [x] Define evaluation criteria (simplicity, completeness, Next.js fit, theming)
- [x] Draft wireframe-first UI principles + component inventory
- [x] Document decisions with rationale
- **Status:** complete

### Phase 3: Implementation
<!-- 
  WHAT: Actually build/create/write the solution.
  WHY: This is where the work happens. Break into smaller sub-tasks if needed.
-->
- [x] Produce UI plan document (no code changes yet)
- [x] Propose next implementation steps
- **Status:** complete

### Phase 4: Verification
<!-- 
  WHAT: Verify everything works and meets requirements.
  WHY: Catching issues early saves time. Document test results in progress.md.
-->
- [x] Verify plan covers requirements and references sources
- [x] Log outcomes in progress.md
- **Status:** complete

### Phase 5: Delivery
<!-- 
  WHAT: Final review and handoff to user.
  WHY: Ensures nothing is forgotten and deliverables are complete.
-->
- [x] Summarize plan and open questions for user
- **Status:** complete

## Key Questions
<!-- 
  WHAT: Important questions you need to answer during the task.
  WHY: These guide your research and decision-making. Answer them as you go.
  EXAMPLE: 
    1. Should tasks persist between sessions? (Yes - need file storage)
    2. What format for storing tasks? (JSON file)
-->
1. Which UI framework(s) best balance simplicity + completeness for Next.js 16?
2. Which stack supports neo-brutalist styling with minimal overhead?
3. What minimal component set is required for the wireframe MVP?

## Decisions Made
<!-- 
  WHAT: Technical and design decisions you've made, with the reasoning behind them.
  WHY: You'll forget why you made choices. This table helps you remember and justify decisions.
  WHEN: Update whenever you make a significant choice (technology, approach, structure).
  EXAMPLE:
    | Use JSON for storage | Simple, human-readable, built-in Python support |
-->
| Decision | Rationale |
|----------|-----------|
| Use a research-backed shortlist | Avoids premature lock-in without evidence |
| Wireframe-first plan doc | Keeps UI aligned to API and reduces UI churn |

## Errors Encountered
<!-- 
  WHAT: Every error you encounter, what attempt number it was, and how you resolved it.
  WHY: Logging errors prevents repeating the same mistakes. This is critical for learning.
  WHEN: Add immediately when an error occurs, even if you fix it quickly.
  EXAMPLE:
    | FileNotFoundError | 1 | Check if file exists, create empty list if not |
    | JSONDecodeError | 2 | Handle empty file case explicitly |
-->
| Error | Attempt | Resolution |
|-------|---------|------------|
| web.run open invalid ref_id | 1 | Rerun search and use returned ref_ids |
| web.run open UnexpectedStatusCode | 1 | Retry with fetch tool or alternate access |
| web.run open UnexpectedStatusCode (direct URL) | 2 | Switch to fetch tool for content |

## Notes
<!-- 
  REMINDERS:
  - Update phase status as you progress: pending → in_progress → complete
  - Re-read this plan before major decisions (attention manipulation)
  - Log ALL errors - they help avoid repetition
  - Never repeat a failed action - mutate your approach instead
