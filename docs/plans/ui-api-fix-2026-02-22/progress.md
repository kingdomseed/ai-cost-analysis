# Progress Log
<!-- 
  WHAT: Your session log - a chronological record of what you did, when, and what happened.
  WHY: Answers "What have I done?" in the 5-Question Reboot Test. Helps you resume after breaks.
  WHEN: Update after completing each phase or encountering errors. More detailed than task_plan.md.
-->

## Session: 2026-02-22
<!-- 
  WHAT: The date of this work session.
  WHY: Helps track when work happened, useful for resuming after time gaps.
  EXAMPLE: 2026-01-15
-->

### Phase 1: Requirements & Discovery

  - `docs/plans/ui-api-fix-2026-02-22/progress.md` (updated)

### Phase 2: Planning & Structure
<!-- 
  WHAT: Same structure as Phase 1, for the next phase.

  - Added token meter selector based on catalog token meters
  - Fixed Radix imports and dependencies
  - Repaired catalog regions derivation and tool→provider mapping
  - Updated API contract catalog fields
- Files created/modified:
  - `apps/public-calculator/site/src/app/page.tsx`
  - `apps/public-calculator/site/src/app/api/catalog/route.ts`
  - `apps/public-calculator/site/src/components/ui/button.tsx`
  - `apps/public-calculator/site/src/components/ui/badge.tsx`

  - `apps/public-calculator/site/package-lock.json`
  - `docs/public-calculator/api-contract.md`

## Test Results
<!-- 
  WHAT: Table of tests you ran, what you expected, what actually happened.
  WHY: Documents verification of functionality. Helps catch regressions.
  WHEN: Update as you test features, especially during Phase 4 (Testing & Verification).
  EXAMPLE:
    | Add task | python todo.py add "Buy milk" | Task added | Task added successfully | ✓ |
    | List tasks | python todo.py list | Shows all tasks | Shows all tasks | ✓ |
-->
| Test | Input | Expected | Actual | Status |
|------|-------|----------|--------|--------|
| Next build | `npm run build` (apps/public-calculator/site) | Build succeeds | Build succeeded | ✓ |

## Error Log
<!-- 
  WHAT: Detailed log of every error encountered, with timestamps and resolution attempts.
  WHY: More detailed than task_plan.md's error table. Helps you learn from mistakes.
  WHEN: Add immediately when an error occurs, even if you fix it quickly.
  EXAMPLE:
    | 2026-01-15 10:35 | FileNotFoundError | 1 | Added file existence check |
    | 2026-01-15 10:37 | JSONDecodeError | 2 | Added empty file handling |
-->
<!-- Keep ALL errors - they help avoid repetition -->
| Timestamp | Error | Attempt | Resolution |
|-----------|-------|---------|------------|
|           |       | 1       |            |

## 5-Question Reboot Check
<!-- 
  WHAT: Five questions that verify your context is solid. If you can answer these, you're on track.
  WHY: This is the "reboot test" - if you can answer all 5, you can resume work effectively.
  WHEN: Update periodically, especially when resuming after a break or context reset.
  
  THE 5 QUESTIONS:
  1. Where am I? → Current phase in task_plan.md
  2. Where am I going? → Remaining phases
  3. What's the goal? → Goal statement in task_plan.md
  4. What have I learned? → See findings.md
  5. What have I done? → See progress.md (this file)
-->
<!-- If you can answer these, context is solid -->
| Question | Answer |
|----------|--------|
| Where am I? | Phase 5 |
| Where am I going? | Delivery/summary |
| What's the goal? | Restore API-first behavior and remove guessing in UI/API |
| What have I learned? | See findings.md |
| What have I done? | Implemented fixes + ran build |
